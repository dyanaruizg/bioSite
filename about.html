                                The Chemical Engineer Christian Ruiz García was born in Tucson, Arizona, on December 21, 1994—Son of Agustín Ruiz 
                                Moreno and Diana Dolores García Trujillo, originally from Mexico with Spanish descent.
                                The place where he grew up as a son is in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora. Although he was born in Tucson, when he was two 
                                years old, his parents decided to change cities to establish a business and be closer to his paternal grandmother.
                                He studied the entire primary level at the Carlos M. Calleja School, where he spent the most beautiful moments of 
                                his childhood, where he discovered what friendship was, the love of a teacher, and the challenges of being a good 
                                student. He was given many academic recognitions for his excellent performance and obtained an honorable mention 
                                upon completing his studies. He studied the basic level at the Industrial and Services Technological Baccalaureate 
                                Center No. 37, where he managed to stand out as a clinical laboratory technician, learning many concepts in the 
                                field of health. Due to the creation of experiments in the laboratory, he decided to study for a university degree 
                                in chemical engineering.

                                He graduated as a Chemical Engineer and lived for a few months in Nacozari, where he worked in the Grupo México mine. 
                                Still, due to his solitary life, he decided to return to his family. Months later, he decided to move to the city of 
                                Texas with his friend to seek better opportunities for improvement and economic stability. However, it only lasted a 
                                few months due to the high temperatures and the enslaving life he led. In 2018, he finally settled in one place to 
                                have his own home, peace of mind, and not so much movement. After that, he excelled in his work environment; he 
                                quickly moved up positions and adapted to a new language. From then on, only good things happened to him, and he hopes to 
                                continue growing professionally and personally. He considers himself a very fair and restless person, creative, friendly, 
                                and with a lot of energy to learn everything that comes his way. He is frank and likes to be treated the same way.
