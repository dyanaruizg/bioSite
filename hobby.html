                    In this section, you can see a little about Christian Ruiz's hobbies. 
                    He likes to spend his free time with his friends and family. He loves going out to parties but also 
                    enjoys watching series or movies at home. He wants to listen to music while he cooks or cleans his 
                    house. He listens to various music, but regional Mexican music is more so. Another of his hobbies 
                    is going on trips with his friends and trying the typical food of the places he visits. He loves 
                    shopping on his days off, playing video games on his PlayStation 4, and having beers with his friends 
                    at his house or a restaurant bar. He goes to music festivals and enjoys meeting new bands if he can. 
                    He also likes extreme sports like skydiving and snowboarding, as well as more sports like baseball, 
                    to the point of visiting stadiums to watch games of his favorite teams. Generally, when he is not 
                    working, he goes to the gym to swim in the pool and exercise a little.
